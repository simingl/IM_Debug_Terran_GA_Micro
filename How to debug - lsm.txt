There is a guide that helped in setting this up, but it was a bit outdated, so this is an updated version. The old guide can be found here: http://starcraftai.lefora.com/2009/11/20/guide-debugging-your-ai-dll/

Visual C++
Change the build type to Debug with the drop down at the top
If you are using a commit older than revision e3d747, you will need to change the following in the project properties:
Under 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor', remove the value '_DEBUG' from the list of Preprocessor Definitions
Under 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation', set the 'Runtime Library' field to 'Multi-threaded DLL /MD'
Under 'Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input', set the 'Additional Dependencies' field to contain the following: ../lib/BWAPI.lib ../lib/BWTA.lib ../lib/tinyxml.lib ../lib/CGAL-vc90-mt.lib ../lib/gmp-vc90-mt.lib ../lib/libboost_thread-vc90-mt-1_40.lib ../lib/mpfr-vc90-mt.lib
From the menu, select Build -> Build Solution
If this fails for whatever reason, make sure that you are not currently running the debugger (you will see play/pause/stop buttons). Additionally, you can try Build -> Clean Build before doing Build Solution.

Chaoslauncher
Copy the built dll from the Debug folder to the bwapi-data/AI folder
Make sure you have your bwapi.ini file set up correctly for the ai variable
Run Chaoslauncher as you always would. While there is an option for injecting DEBUG, it does not seem to work, so use RELEASE.
Start Starcraft
Starting the Game
Any time that Starcraft has started (not necessarily in a game), you may attach the debugger
Go to Debug -> Attach to Process..
Find "Starcraft.exe" (you can type "sta" to jump down the list) and click Attach
